# IoT-Based-Air-Quality-Monitoring-System
An IoT-based system that monitors air quality using Arduino Uno and ESP32. It collects data from 8 MQ gas sensors, PMS5003 (PM2.5 &amp; PM10), and BMP280 (temperature, humidity, pressure). The data is transferred via serial communication and can be sent to the cloud for real-time analysis and visualization.
